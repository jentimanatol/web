    CMT 111 
Spring 2025
 Mid Term Project
 Create a site structure for a home page that will inform people about various 
aquariums in the world.  Do not focus on only one region.
 You are to have a banner image with an overlay that displays your name over 
the words “Aquariums to be Seen” with proper spacing between.  The banner 
image must be of your own design.  If you do not have PhotoShop you can 
download and use Gimp for free. You may also create an image with Adobe 
Firefly, Microsoft Copilot or any other free version of an AI image generator.
 You must have a nav section that is positioned underneath, the header section.
 (Lookup HTML semantic elements on W3Schools).  The navigation links need to 
be separated with an appropriate symbol ('font awesome' is preferred) (Lookup 
W3Schools - Font Awesome).
 All links must open in new tabs in the browser.
 You are to have a page narrative that discusses the reasons for aquariums and 
the benefits of maintaining aquariums for both the animals and the people that 
visit. Your narrative must be extensive and fill a majority of the page. It must be 
in your own words.  Lorem Ipsom text is not acceptable. AI generated 
paragraphs are accetpable if you modify it to reflect your own views.
 You must use fonts that are obtained from another source. (i.e. Google fonts)
 You must use at least three HTML5 semantic elements in your page design. 
(Lookup HTML5 semantic elements on W3Schools) 
You must have hyperlinks to at least 5 aquariums in the world.  All links must 
display a hover effect.  (Lookup hover effect on W3Schools) You must have a 
footer that identifies you as the page author with a copyright symbol.  You 
must have multiple images on the page that are mixed in with the text 
narrative.  All content images are to be the same size.
All content is to be displayed using CSS to control the appearance and 
functionality of the page.  The CSS page must be external and linked to the 
index page. (lookup W3Schools linking CSS). All CSS rules must be of your 
origin.
 You may not use on-line templates for your layout (they are traceable).  You 
must use your own layout design.
 In addition to the functionality requirements, you will be graded on the 
aesthetic presentation of your site.
 The project must be submitted as an entire site structure and must be 
submitted as one compressed folder.  Projects that are submitted without 
a site structure will not be graded.
 Review video if necessary.

        Aquariums are not just places to observe marine life; they are vital institutions that educate, inspire, and promote conservation. 
        In New England, several aquariums stand out for their commitment to marine education and conservation efforts. 
        The New England Aquarium in Boston is a leader in marine research and public engagement, featuring the iconic Giant Ocean Tank and a variety of exhibits showcasing diverse marine ecosystems. 
        Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut is known for its interactive exhibits and research programs, particularly its work with beluga whales. 
        The Maritime Aquarium in Norwalk focuses on the marine life of Long Island Sound, offering hands-on experiences that connect visitors with local ecosystems. 
        Seacoast Science Center in New Hampshire emphasizes education about the Gulf of Maine's marine environment through interactive exhibits and programs. 
        Finally, the Maine State Aquarium showcases local species and provides educational opportunities about the state's unique marine life.

        These aquariums play a crucial role in fostering a deeper understanding of marine ecosystems and the importance of conservation efforts. 
        By visiting these institutions, individuals can learn about the challenges facing our oceans and how they can contribute to preserving marine biodiversity. 
        Aquariums also serve as centers for research and rehabilitation, working to protect endangered species and restore damaged habitats. 
        In summary, aquariums are essential for promoting awareness and action towards marine conservation, making them invaluable resources for both education and environmental stewardship.
