          Welcome to Aquariums to be Seen — your premier guide to discovering the mesmerizing underwater worlds within
          New
          England and beyond. We are passionate storytellers, ocean lovers, and curious minds dedicated to promoting the
          beauty, science, and wonder of aquariums everywhere. Whether you're a lifelong marine enthusiast or a curious
          first-time visitor, our mission is to connect you with the most captivating aquatic experiences this
          region—and
          the world—has to offer.

          From the bustling shores of Boston to the tranquil coastlines of Maine, we shine a spotlight on every public
          aquarium that educates, conserves, and inspires. We believe aquariums are more than just attractions — they
          are
          living classrooms where conservation meets curiosity, and where people of all ages can develop a deeper
          understanding of life beneath the waves.

          We proudly feature direct links to iconic marine institutions like the New England Aquarium, Mystic Aquarium,
          The Maritime Aquarium, Seacoast Science Center, and the Maine State Aquarium. Our platform is built to inform,
          engage, and help you plan unforgettable aquatic adventures, all while supporting the ongoing efforts of marine
          preservation.

          So dive in. Explore. Learn. And join us as we celebrate the incredible aquatic life that swims just beneath
          the
          surface—and the passionate people working to protect it.
